## Call method

- The call method is used to invoke a function directly, by passing in the reference which points to the this variable inside the method

## Apply method

- Apply is exactly same as the call method, the only difference is, it takes the second argument as the arrayList of the parameters which needs to be passed to this printFullName function

## Bind method

- And similarly, bind method doesn't directly invokes the method, but gives you the copy of that exactly same method which can be invoked later
